# AppSumo Title Collector Extension

**Project Name (repository):** `create-a-scraper-me-20250615_214515`

## Overview

The AppSumo Title Collector Extension is a Chrome browser extension designed to help users efficiently collect product titles from the AppSumo website. Users can click on product titles on AppSumo pages to save them to a local list within the extension. This collected list can then be exported as a CSV file for offline use, streamlining the research process for Lifetime Deals (LTDs) and other products.

This extension is particularly useful for marketers, entrepreneurs, and AppSumo enthusiasts who want to keep track of interesting deals without manually copying and pasting titles.

For more detailed project documentation, please refer to `projectdocumentation.md`.

## Features

*   **One-Click Title Collection:** Easily save AppSumo product titles by simply clicking on them on AppSumo pages.
*   **Interactive Title Highlighting:** Product titles on AppSumo pages are visually distinguished or made interactive (e.g., with a 'Save Title' icon/button) for easy identification.
*   **Persistent Local Storage:** Collected titles are stored securely within your browser's local storage until you decide to clear them.
*   **CSV Export:** Export your list of collected product titles as a CSV file, ready for use in spreadsheets or other data management tools.
*   **Browser Action Popup:**
    *   Quick access to extension functionalities via an icon in the Chrome toolbar.
    *   Displays the current count of saved titles.
    *   Provides an "Export to CSV" button.
    *   Includes a "Clear All Saved Titles" button to reset your list.
*   **User Feedback:** Receive status messages in the popup for actions like successful export, data clearing, or any errors encountered.
*   **Targeted Functionality:** Specifically designed to work on AppSumo product listing, category, and individual product pages (e.g., `https://appsumo.com/browse/*`, `https://appsumo.com/categories/*`, `https://appsumo.com/products/*`).

## Architecture

The extension follows a standard Chrome Extension architecture:

1.  **Manifest (`manifest.json`):**
    *   Defines the extension's metadata, version, and name.
    *   Specifies necessary permissions: `storage` (for saving titles), `downloads` (for exporting CSV).
    *   Sets host permissions for `*://*.appsumo.com/*` to interact with AppSumo pages.
    *   Registers the background service worker, content scripts, and browser action popup.
    *   References extension icons (e.g., `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`).

2.  **Content Script (`appsumoproducttitleinteractor.js` and `onpageproducttitlestyles.css`):**
    *   Injected into AppSumo web pages.
    *   `appsumoproducttitleinteractor.js`: Identifies product title DOM elements, makes them interactive (styled by `onpageproducttitlestyles.css`), captures titles on click, and sends them to the background script. Provides optional visual feedback on the page.
    *   `onpageproducttitlestyles.css`: Provides CSS rules for styling interactive elements and visual feedback on AppSumo pages.

3.  **Background Service Worker (`extensioncorelogichandler.js`):**
    *   Runs in the background, managing data and core logic.
    *   Uses `chrome.storage.local` for persistent storage of collected titles.
    *   Listens for messages from content and popup scripts.
    *   Handles adding titles to storage (potential for duplicate checking).
    *   Generates CSV content and initiates downloads using the `chrome.downloads` API.
    *   Manages clearing stored titles and providing title counts.

4.  **Browser Action Popup (`extensionuserinterfacepopup.html`, `extensionpopupstylesheet.css`, `extensionpopupinteractionhandler.js`):**
    *   The UI displayed when the extension icon is clicked.
    *   `extensionuserinterfacepopup.html`: Defines the popup's HTML structure (buttons for export, clear, title count display).
    *   `extensionpopupstylesheet.css`: Styles the popup interface.
    *   `extensionpopupinteractionhandler.js`: Handles user interactions within the popup (e.g., button clicks), communicates with the background script, and updates the popup display with counts and status messages.

## Files Included

*   `manifest.json`: The core manifest file for the Chrome extension.
*   `appsumoproducttitleinteractor.js`: Content script for interacting with AppSumo pages.
*   `onpageproducttitlestyles.css`: CSS for styling elements injected by the content script.
*   `extensioncorelogichandler.js`: Background service worker for core logic and data management.
*   `extensionuserinterfacepopup.html`: HTML structure for the browser action popup.
*   `extensionpopupinteractionhandler.js`: JavaScript for popup interactivity and communication.
*   `extensionpopupstylesheet.css`: CSS for styling the popup.
*   `icon16.png`: 16x16 pixel icon for the extension.
*   `icon48.png`: 48x48 pixel icon for the extension.
*   `icon128.png`: 128x128 pixel icon for the extension.
*   `projectdocumentation.md`: Detailed internal project documentation.
*   *(Example Output)* `appsumo_collected_titles_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.csv`: This is an example of the file format generated when you export titles. It is not part of the project source files.

## How to Use

### A. Product Title Collection Flow

1.  **Navigate to AppSumo:** Open any AppSumo product listing, category, or product page (e.g., `https://appsumo.com/browse/`, `https://appsumo.com/categories/some-category`, `https://appsumo.com/products/some-product/`).
2.  **Identify Interactive Titles:** The extension's content script (`appsumoproducttitleinteractor.js`) will automatically run. It will modify product titles on the page to make them distinctly clickable (e.g., by adding a specific style or a small 'save' icon).
3.  **Save a Title:** Hover over or identify a product title you wish to save. Click the interactive element associated with that product title.
4.  **Confirmation (Optional):** The content script may provide visual feedback on the AppSumo page (e.g., a "Saved!" message or a change in the icon's appearance) to indicate the title has been successfully saved.
5.  **Repeat:** Collect as many titles as you need by repeating steps 3-4.

### B. Data Export & Management Flow

1.  **Open the Popup:** Click the AppSumo Title Collector extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
2.  **View Information:** A popup window will appear, displaying:
    *   The current count of saved titles.
    *   An "Export Saved Titles to CSV" button.
    *   A "Clear All Saved Titles" button.
3.  **Export Titles:**
    *   Click the "Export Saved Titles to CSV" button.
    *   The background script will generate a CSV file (e.g., `appsumo_collected_titles_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.csv`) containing all your saved titles.
    *   This file will be automatically downloaded to your browser's default downloads folder.
    *   The popup will display a confirmation or error message.
4.  **Clear Titles:**
    *   If you wish to remove all saved titles from the extension's storage, click the "Clear All Saved Titles" button.
    *   Confirm the action if prompted. The title count in the popup will update to 0.

## Dependencies

*   **Google Chrome Browser:** This extension is built for Google Chrome and relies on Chrome Extension APIs.
*   No external libraries are required for the core functionality of the extension.

## Important Notes

*   **Icon Files:** This project requires `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, and `icon128.png` for the extension to display correctly in the Chrome browser (toolbar, extensions page, etc.). Ensure these files are present in the root directory of the extension or in an `icons/` subdirectory as referenced in `manifest.json`.
*   **AppSumo DOM Structure:** The extension's ability to identify product titles (`appsumoproducttitleinteractor.js`) depends on the current DOM structure of AppSumo web pages. If AppSumo significantly changes its website layout, the selectors used to find titles might need to be updated.
*   **Permissions:** The extension requests the following permissions:
    *   `storage`: To save and retrieve the list of collected titles.
    *   `downloads`: To allow the export of the title list as a CSV file.
    *   `host_permissions` for `*://*.appsumo.com/*`: To allow the content script to run on AppSumo pages.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is implemented to provide feedback via the popup UI. For instance, if CSV generation or download fails.
*   **MVP Focus:** The current version focuses on core functionality. Future enhancements could include duplicate title detection, editing/deleting individual titles, or organizing titles into multiple lists.
